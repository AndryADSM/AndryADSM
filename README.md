Hi! I am Andry Da Silva 👾, a passionate data analyst born in Venezuela, currently living in Ecuador. I was homeschooled 🏫 and got my high school diploma from Home Life Academy, Jackson, TN, which has made me an independent and motivated hard working person! ✊

My multicultural background 🌎 always brings a fresh and useful perspective to my work and team 🗺️. Spanish is my native language but I am fluent in English too!

On top of all things data science I also like metal music 🎸 and orchestra, calisthenics 🤸, economy 🏦, specially the stock market in which I even have experience trading! 💸, and videogames 🎮 like Minecraft which have fueled my interest in data, analytics, story telling, programming, simplifying complicated concepts, creating useful things and making things useful! ⚒️

I have always had highly creative problem-solving skills 💡, attention for detail, resilience and drive to go the extra step for greatness and bring everyone along for the journey! 😁
