Hi! I am Andry Da Silva 👾, from South America, I was homeschooled 🏫 and got my high school diploma from Home Life Academy, Jackson, TN. My multicultural background 🌎 always brings a fresh perspective to my work and team. I speak Spanish and English.

A highly creative resilient problem solver 💡 with attention for detail alongside hard and smart work 🧠, knowledgeable in varied domains such as economics, the stock market, sales, business management 💸, calisthenics 🤸, videogames 🎮 and music 🎸.

I shine at simplifying complicated concepts, storytelling and adapting to any environment. I love learning new things, staying up to science, ​​creating useful things and making things useful! ⚒️
